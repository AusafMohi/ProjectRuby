# ProjectRuby
This Ruby code prompts the user to enter the number of software packages purchased. It then calculates the total amount of the purchase based on a per-package price of $99. The code applies different discount rates depending on the quantity purchased. Finally, it displays the discount amount and the total amount after the discount.
